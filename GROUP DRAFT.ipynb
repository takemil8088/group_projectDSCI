    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The gaming industry is expanding by the year, and efforts are made to study player's actions for a more targetted recruitment. To achieve this, researchers must predict what types of players are more likely to contribute to the games and determine which player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how these features differ between various player types. This science project aims to specifically answer whether play hours and the player's age predict whether a player will subscribe to the Minecraft newsletter or not. In order to answer this, we used data obtained from a Minecraft server which contain specific player information and whether they subscribe to the newsletter or not. The dataset, named \"players\", portrays a list of players and their data (7 variables, 196 observations): player's experience (amateur, beginner, pro, regular, veteran), subscription status (TRUE: subscribed to newsletter, FALSE: not subscribed), hashed Email that uniquely identifies each player, game play hours, player name, player gender, and player age. \n",
    "The dataset reveals that 144 players are subscribed, and 52 are not. Play hours range from 0 to 223.1 hours, and age range from 8 to 50 years old.\n"

    "We will be answering our question using K-nearest neighbors Classification, tuning our model to obtain the highest prediction accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The predictors we will be using will be strictly numerical: total time the player spent playing (hours) and player age (years). The categorical variable we will be predicting is \"subscribe\" (TRUE; subscribed or FALSE; not subscribed). \n",
    "Summary of wrangled dataset:\n",
    "- Player subscribed: (144) and not subscribed (52)\n",
    "- Play hours range: 0 to 223.1 hours\n",

    "\n",
    "The players dataset was wrangled to counter some potential issues, including the removal of NA values. The dataset also included some outliers where some players were much older or younger than the mean (which was 20.5 years), or where players played significantly more or less hours than the mean (which was 5.9 hours). However, these outliers were kept to contain the data size and retain information for the model to train off of. "

    "Data analysis using our K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier found that hours played and player age cannot accurately predict whether a player will subscribe to the newsletter or not. In the plot of the test data, despite having a high accuracy and precision, in addition to a recall of 100%, the model classified all players as likely to subscribe, regardless of their actual subscription. This shows that while the model can perfectly identify subscribed players (as shown in the perfect recall), it cannot accurately differentiate between subscribers and non-subscribers. Thus, this limits the model's predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "This outcome was not expected. Graph 1 shows that players with higher playing time tend to subscribe, and Graph 2 demonstrates that older players are less likely to subscribe. This should mean that played hours and age should be impactful predictors, but it was not. There seemed to be a relationship between the variables and subscription, but the KNN model's overclassification of players as subscribed tells otherwise. This imbalance could be due to the dataset having more subscribed players (144) than non-subscribers (52), which would lead to undersampling and cause the model to lean toward the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings show that played hours and age are not reliable for predicting subscription. In companies for games like Minecraft, this tells marketers to look at other possible predictors, like in-game preferences. Despite the model's perfect recall, it is biased towards the majority class (subscribed players, who outnumber non-subscribers). Overall, this shows that more diverse and balanced data is necessary to create more accurate models to understand player subscription behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides needing to know what other factors can help better understand player subscription, it is important to ask if the dataset is the problem. This means that played hours and age could have been reliable indicators with stronger data. Future research could explore the impact of minimizing the bias in our model, and whether alternative datasets are key. Additionally, exploring more player characteristics like spending habits and social engagement can contribute to predictions, as incorporating more predictors could further improve the model's ability to identify subscribers. Another unique exploration would be seeing if these findings are specific to Minecraft only, or if it is the same for every video game."
